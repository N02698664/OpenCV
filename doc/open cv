I initially installed OpenCV from the apt-get sources but found out that version of OpenCV available through apt-get for
ARM processors is only the 2.3 version and that version does not include the facial recognition libraries by default.

I installed the facial recognition libraries using cmake and the walkthrough from here:
http://thinkrpi.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/step-3-install-softwares-for-webcam-and-computer-vision/

I had a hard time making this work; it seemed to compile but didn't really seem to actually work when tested.

Eventually after some more research I found an install script that installed a more current complete version of OpenCV
using these commands.
wget https://raw.github.com/jayrambhia/Install-OpenCV/master/Ubuntu/2.4/opencv2_4_6_1.sh
chmod +x opencv2_4_6_1.sh
./opencv2_4_6_1.sh

This is a Github project where someone creates a new install script for the current version of OpenCV

This took all night but now I should be able to use the facial recognition libraries that are included in OpenCV.

I also installed SimpleCV to play with the SimpleCV shell - this required that I install a ton of python math libraries.
I might try and work something with one of the web cam projects to try and use the SimpleCV functions....

When the SimpleCV shell errored on start up I had to install some extra python libraries using the command
sudo pip svg install.

I believe that pip was another tool installed with the python-tools package similar to the easy-install tool that I
installed for pyinotify.
