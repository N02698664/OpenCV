I wanted to create a Samba share to allow me to upload files into a watched folder from any Windows machine.

I originally used the setup a Windows file server walk-through from Simon the Pi Man @

http://simonthepiman.com/how_to_setup_windows_file_server_wheezy.php

I was able to install Samba with sudo apt-get install samba, samba-common-bin, smbclient.

I then tried to create a new Samba share using the parameters that Simon used modified to my needs in smb.conf:

Uncomment out security = user by removing the # from the start of the line:

[OpenCV]
   comment = OpenCV Share
   path = /users/pi/OpenCV
   writeable = Yes
   create mask = 0777
   directory mask = 0777
   browseable = Yes
   public = yes
   guest ok = no
   valid users = pi
   
and added the password for pi into the Samba database: smbpasswd -a pi
   
but despite being able to see the folder on the network - I wasn't ever able to map it as a network drive - it wouldn't
take my user name or password.

After a little bit of research I found that the default Samba share is to share the users home directories
somewhere - can't find it now - check my browser histories.

try this again....

the default user shares were only readable initially - but I had to change the writeable variable to yes and changed
the masks to 0777.
