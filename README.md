OpenCV
======

Raspberry Pi / OpenCV project

This project is for the Embedded Linux class at SUNY New Paltz.
Original concept is to use the Raspberry Pi to process an image file uploaded into a monitored folder using pyinotify.
The results would be placed into the same folder when completed.
I plan to use the Python wrapper for OpenCV and eventually create the ability to upload a .txt file with parameters
to determine what is processed.
